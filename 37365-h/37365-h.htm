<P CLASS="poem">
Scorn not the Old; 'twas sacred in its day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A truth overpowering error with its might,<BR>
A light dispelling darkness with its ray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A victory won, an intermediate height,<BR>
Which seers untrammel'd by their creeds of yore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes and saints, triumphantly attained<BR>
With hard assail and tribulation sore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we might use the vantage-ground they gain'd.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Scorn not the Old; but hail and seize the New<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thrill'd intelligences, hearts that burn,<BR>
And such truth-seeking spirits that it, too,<BR>

And men may ever, as the ages roll,<BR>
March onward toward the still receding goal.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
How many a man of those I see around<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has cherished fair ideals in his youth,<BR>
And heard the spirit's call, and stood spellbound<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the shrine of Beauty or of Truth,<BR>
And lived to see his fair ideals fade,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel a numbness creep upon his soul,<BR>
And sadly know himself no longer swayed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By rigorous Truth or Beauty's sweet control!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For some, alas! life's thread is almost spun;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few, few and poor, the fibres that remain;<BR>
But yet, while life lasts, something may be done<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the heavenly vision not in vain;<BR>
Yet, even yet, some triumph may be won,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, loss itself be turned to precious gain.<BR>

THE SADDEST THOUGHT.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sad is the wane of beauty to the fair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad is the flux of fortune to the proud,<BR>
Sad is the look dejected lovers wear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sad is worth beneath detraction's cloud.<BR>
Sad is our youth's inexorable end,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad is the bankruptcy of fancy's wealth,<BR>
Sad is the last departure of a friend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sadder than most things is loss of health.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And yet more sad than these to think upon<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this&mdash;the saddest thought beneath the sun&mdash;<BR>
Life, flowing like a river, almost gone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into eternity, and nothing done.<BR>
Let me be spared that bootless last regret:<BR>
Let me work now; I may do something yet.<BR>

As one who finds his house no longer fit,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too narrow for his needs, in nothing right,<BR>
Wanting in every homelike requisite,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devoid of beauty, barren of delight,<BR>
Goes forth from door to door and street to street,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eager-eyed expectancy to find<BR>
A new abode for his convenience meet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious, commodious, fair, and to his mind;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So living souls recurrently outgrow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mental tenements; their tastes appear<BR>
Too sordid, and their aims too cramped and low.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they keep moving onward year by year,<BR>
Each dwelling in its turn prepared to leave<BR>
For one more like the mansion they conceive.<BR>

Of faery isles, serene amid the roars<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of baffled seas, let in all fair delights<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such as make happy days and restful nights)<BR>
To tread familiarly its charmèd floors.<BR>

Within its walls let moderate Plenty reign,<BR>

The embattled legions of the cherubim;<BR>

So shall the scholar pause within this door<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With startled reverence, and proudly stand,<BR>

By Time's rude breath, their spoils are here in store,<BR>

"Who first invented work?" asks Elia, he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose life to an ungenial task was wed,<BR>
And answers, "Satan"; but it could not be&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On idleness his foul ambition fed;<BR>
By idleness the heavenly domiciles<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were lost to him and all his idle crew;<BR>
In idleness he hatches all his wiles,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mischief finds for idle hands to do.<BR>

His business ever was to scamp and shirk,<BR>

He never knew the zest of honest work,<BR>

The land and cattle on it, and the sea<BR>

THE IDEAL PREACHER.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
It was back in Renfrew County, near the Opeongo line,<BR>
Where the land's all hills and hollows and the hills are clothed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with pine,<BR>
And in the wooded valleys little lakes shine here and there<BR>
Like jewels in the masses of a lovely woman's hair;<BR>
Where the York branch, by a channel ripped through rugged rocks<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sand,<BR>
Sweeps to join the Madawaska, speeding downward to the Grand;<BR>
Where the landscape glows with beauty, like a halo shed abroad,<BR>
And the face of nature mirrors back the unseen face of God.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I was weary with my journey, and with difficulty strove<BR>
To keep myself awake at first, as, sitting by the stove<BR>
In old William Rankin's shanty, I attended as I might<BR>
To the pioneer backwoodsman's tales far on into the night;<BR>
But William talked until the need of sleep one quite forgot,<BR>
Not stopping but to stir the fire, which kept the stove red-hot;<BR>
For the wind was raw and cold without, although the month of May:<BR>
Up north the winter struggles hard before it yields its sway;<BR>
And the snow is in the forests, and the ice is in the lakes,<BR>
And the frost is in the seedland oft when sunny June awakes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He talked of camps in winter time, of river drives in spring,<BR>
Of discords in the settlement,&mdash;in fact, of everything;<BR>
He told of one good elder who'd been eaten by a bear,<BR>
And wondered that a beast of prey should eat a man of pray'r;<BR>
Of beast, from wolf to porcupine, killed with gun, axe and fork,<BR>
And, finally, of college men who did not pine for pork.<BR>
"But yet among them students," said the bushman, "there wuz one<BR>
As hit me an' the settlement as fair as any gun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"O' course, he wa'nt no buster, hed no shinin' gifts o' speech;<BR>
But jis' as reg'lar he could give some pointers how to preach.<BR>
He talked straight on like tellin' yarns&mdash;more heart, I'd say, 'an head;<BR>
But somehow people felt he meant 'bout every word he said.<BR>
He wa'n't chuck full o' larnin' from the peelin' to the core;&mdash;<BR>
Leastwise, he wa'n't the kind they call a college batch-o'-lore;<BR>
He'd no degree, the schoolma'am said,&mdash;though soon he let 'em see<BR>
That o' certain sterlin' qualities he had a great degree,&mdash;<BR>
Leastwise he hed no letters till the hind end o' his name,&mdash;<BR>
But, preacher, say, you don't set much importance by them same?&mdash;<BR>
Y' may hev titles o' y'r own, an' think I'm speakin' bold;<BR>
But there's that bob-tailed nag o' mine, the chestnut three-year-old;<BR>
It's true she can't make such a swish, to scare away the flies,<BR>
But if y'd see her cover ground, y'd scarce believe y'r eyes.<BR>

"O' course, he hed his enemies,&mdash;you preachers alluz hez,&mdash;<BR>
But 'twa'n't no use their tellin' us he wa'n't the stuff, I gez;<BR>
An' after while they closed right up an' looked like,&mdash;it wuz fun,&mdash;<BR>
When they seed the way he 'sisted out ol' Game-leg Templeton.<BR>
O' course, y' knows ol' Templeton,&mdash;twuz him as druv y' in;<BR>
Y' noticed, maybe, how he limped, and sort o' saved his shin.<BR>
He's run the mail through fair and foul 'tween this and Cumbermere,<BR>
And faithful served Her Majesty fur nigh on twenty year.<BR>

"The preacher stayed with Templeton, the same's you're stay'n' with me,<BR>
On a new clearance back o' this, which, course, y' didn't see.<BR>
An' one day on a visit tour the chap wuz startin' out<BR>
In the way o' Little Carlow,&mdash;twuz good twelve mile round about,&mdash;<BR>
An' in the bush he'd lose hisself, as everybody knowed:<BR>
'I'll take the axe,' says Templeton, 'an' go an' blaze a road.<BR>
It's only three mile through the bush.'  An' so they started in,<BR>
Quite happy like,&mdash;men never knows when troubles will begin.<BR>
'Bout noon,&mdash;the folks was in the house a eatin' o' their snack,&mdash;<BR>
The chap comes home with Templeton a-hangin' on his back.<BR>

He was up the Long Lake section, seein'&mdash;what's that fellow's name?&mdash;<BR>
Well, never mind.&mdash;An' when he did examine of the wound,<BR>
He said 'twould take all summer fur the man to git around.<BR>

An' there wa'nt no binders in them days, and work wuz work, sure pop.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Well, when the people heerd about the way that preacher done,<BR>
All on 'em growed religious straight, sir, every mother's son;<BR>
The meetin'-house wuz crowded from the pulpit to the door&mdash;<BR>
Some on 'em hadn't showed face there fur twenty year or more;<BR>
An' them as sot out on the fence an' gossiped all the while,<BR>
Jis' brought the fence planks in and sot down on 'em in the aisle,<BR>
An' listened,&mdash;sir, no orator as ever spoke aloud<BR>
Worked on his audience the way as that chap on our crowd.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We aint no shakes o' people; we aint up to nothin' new;<BR>
But we knows a man what's shammin' and we knows a man what's true.<BR>
An' when we heerd that preacher talk 'bout Christian sacrifice<BR>
And bearin' burdens for the weak, we valued his advice;<BR>
An' we showed it&mdash;there wuz nothin' as we thought too good for him;<BR>
We poured our cup o' gratitude an' filled it to the brim.<BR>

The way it shined the brightest, an' he jined another camp.<BR>
But most men,&mdash;leastwise such as him,&mdash;I take it, fur my part,<BR>
Aint got much devil in their brains when God is in their heart;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
My name is Tim O'Gallagher,&mdash;there's Oirish in that same;<BR>
My parients from the Imerald Oisle beyant the ocean came;<BR>
My father came from Donegal, my mother came from Clare;<BR>
But oi was born in Pontiac, besoide the Belle Rivière.<BR>
Oi spint my choildhood tamin' bears, and fellin' timber trays,<BR>
And catchin' salmon tin fate long&mdash;and doin' what oi plaze.<BR>
Oi got my iddication from the Riverind Father Blake;<BR>
He taught me Latin grammar, and he after taught me Grake,<BR>
Till oi could rade the classics in a distint sort of way&mdash;<BR>
'Twas the sadetoime of the harvist that oi'm rapin' ivery day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My parients thought me monsthrous shmart&mdash;of thim 'twas awful koind,<BR>
And where oi'd go to college now was what perplixed their moind;<BR>
So they axed the Riverind Father Blake what varsity was bist<BR>
To make a docthor, bachelor and lawyer and the rist.<BR>
Said Father Blake, "If oi must make decision, faith! oi will:<BR>
Sure, sind the boy to Munthreal, there's none loike Ould McGill."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So oi came to Munthreal and found McGill one afternoon,<BR>
And saw a great excoited crowd all shoutin' out of tune;<BR>
And in the cintre thorty min was foightin' jist loike mad,<BR>
And two big fellows on the top of one poor little lad.<BR>
Oi turned indignant to the crowd, and tould them to their face:<BR>
"Ye pack of coward savages, onciviloized and base,<BR>
To stand and see two stalwart min abusin' one that way!<BR>
Oi loike a gladiatorial show, but loike to see fair play."<BR>
So oi jumped at those two bullies and oi caught thim by the shirt,<BR>
And oi knocked their hids together and consoigned thim to the dirt.<BR>
Oi was removed and they were carried home, but all the same,<BR>
Though Ould McGill was two min short, she won that football game.<BR>
They thought oi was a tough gussoon, and whin they played agin,<BR>
They put me in the scrimmage&mdash;we got thorty-foive to tin.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oi thin wint up to college whin the lictures would begin;<BR>
Oi attinded ivery licture&mdash;when oi happened to be in;<BR>
Got my work up, kipt my note-books in the illigantist shape;<BR>
Oi took notes of ivery licture&mdash;barrin' whin oi was ashlape.<BR>
But, och! oi try to do my bist, for sure it's Father Blake<BR>
As says the foinist faculty is Arts, and no mistake;<BR>
For there they tache philosophy and English literature,<BR>
The mathematics also, and the classic authors, sure.<BR>
Oi larned the Gracian poethry, oi larned the Latin prose;<BR>
Oi know as much about thim both as my profissor knows:<BR>
How Troy, that had for noine long years defoied the Graycian force,<BR>
Was "hors de combat" put at last by jist a wooden horse;<BR>
How Xerxes wipt because his army soon would pass away,<BR>
And Alexander wipt because there were no more to shlay;<BR>
How Cato from his toga plucked the Carthaginian fruit;<BR>
How Brutus murdered Saysar, and how Saysar called him "Brute."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oi'd the honor of a mornin' with an influential Med,<BR>
And he took me to the room in which they mutilate the dead.<BR>
Oi don't objict to crack a skull or spoil a purty face,<BR>
But to hack a man who's dead is what oi called extramely base.<BR>
But all pursonal convictions, he explained, should be resoigned<BR>
For the binifit of scoience and the good of humankoind;<BR>
And though oi don't at all admoire their ways o' goin' on,<BR>
Oi'll take a course in Medicine, oi will, before oi'm gone.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oi saw the Scoience workshops, too, and thought whin oi was made,<BR>
These little hands were niver mint to larn the blacksmith trade;<BR>
And for that illictricity, the thing what gives the shock,<BR>
They collared old Promaytheus and chained him to a rock<BR>
For a-playin' with the loightnin' and a-raychin to the skoies,<BR>
And the vultures gnawed his vittles, and the crows picked out his oyes.<BR>
But toimes has changed, and larnin' gives us power&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;<BR>
And whin oi'm done with Arts oi'll take that shplindid faculty;<BR>
For, sure, it's from their workshops that the solar system's run;<BR>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
